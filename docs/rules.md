# Rules for AI code generation

1. Every change must be published in the CHANGELOG.md
2. CHANGELOG.MD must be updated with the changes in the format: YYYY-MM-DD - [Version] - [Change Type] - [Change Description]. Version uses SEMVER pattern
3. After every change the project must be built and run to check if it is working correctly
